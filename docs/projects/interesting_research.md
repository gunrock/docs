# Interesting Graph Research Projects with Possible Gunrock Applicability

We may see papers during the course of our work lives that have possible applicability to Gunrock. There's three steps to making use of those:

1. Add these papers here.
2. Summarize what those papers do.
3. Ascertain with the aid of Gunrock-internals experts if these are worth pursuing (as core-Gunrock projects, as projects for new students, and/or as possible external projects). If we know they're good, we can add them to the main docs [here](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#possible-gunrock-projects).

Your todos: Add new papers! Add your summary below for any of these! And/or add your assessment on how well it'd work in Gunrock!

### Summary

Preprocesses scale-free datasets to reduce irregularity by splitting high-degree nodes into sets of lower-degree nodes. This can be done virtually without modifying the underlying graph structure by adding additional virtual data structures atop it.

### Assessment (JDO)

I read this as "requiring preprocessing" but preprocessing times do not appear to be included in the results. This is an incomplete comparison.
